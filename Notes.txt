In APP, I am importing WeatherSearch, Footer, ConversionWidget, Nav, and SearchHistory. But maybe I should have all of those on the Landing Page (HOME). That should get rid of the problem with About.

From App.js, removing...


//Since previous searches are going to go into weather search, I am taking it out of here.

   
// <aside className="previous-searches">
// <section>
//     <h4>Previous Searches</h4>
//     <ul></ul>
// </section>
// </aside>        


/*

============== Got rid of these: =========
         <PreviousSearches /> 
        <Details /> 
// import WeatherApp from './components/weather/WeatherSearch2'

// import UpcomingWeather from './components/weather/UpcomingWeather';

// import Details from './components/weather/Details';

*/
